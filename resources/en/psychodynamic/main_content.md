#Psychodynamic psychology

Psychodynamic psychology is one of the major schools of psychology among numerous schools in practice today, that believes that therapeutic work must seek out, in each and every patient, that which is natural and simple, and reintegrate it into our personality when it needs to be, and when it is possible.

Important research carried out in different parts of the world continually shows the great effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy, and states that it is the treatment of choice, in all of its different forms, for a great many types of mental disorders.

Psychodynamic psychology speaks to us about a conscious and unconscious inner world. It shows us how to perceive it, and connect with our interior. Connecting to ourselves is considered essential for our development and continuing maturation. Being able to connect with this inner world of ours determines greatly our personal resources, our feelings, and how we see and live our lives.

To know oneself is a grand adventure but patients don't generally seek therapeutic or analytic help to get to know themselves better, but rather to alleviate their suffering.

People suffer in many different ways.  The faces of suffering are seen in sadness, in irritability, in obsessive behaviors and beliefs, in relationship problems, in lack of concentration, in anxiety and panic, in fears, â€¦ It can cause problems in human sexuality, and in low school or professional achievement. The internal world of each individual reveals the reasons for suffering. Psychodynamic psychotherapy is based on talking. It is a dialogue that is established between patient and therapist, and it seeks out the causes of the symptoms and suffering the patient has. In psychodynamic therapy, and within the framework of a very special relationship established between therapist and patient, what occurs or has occurred to the patient is explored.

The psychotherapist listens at deep levels because human beings are subtle and complex in the communication of what they feel and what happens to them. The psychotherapist listens respectfully and empathically because the human being deserves respect and empathy, and needs to feel accompanied, well tolerated and understood. No injunctions are made, nor is superficiality offered.

The psychotherapist actively participates in a dialogue about you and everything about you that unfolds in the frame of the psychotherapeutic relationship which offers a unique life experience to the patient in search of help.
