#Frequently Asked Questions

#####If I feel sad, could that mean that I have a depression?

Sadness is not a diagnostic category but rather a symptom of something, and it may have causes that are relatively easy to understand and treat, or causes that are more laboriously understand and treated. The word depression is often synonymous, for the layperson with an ominous diagnostic category.  This is a common mistake.

#####How can talking about myself and about my problems help me?

All psychotherapies are first and foremost a human relationship.  Psychodynamic psychotherapy is also a place of exploring and of investigating as well as for giving treatment. A therapeutic relationship is put to the service of discovering the resources and difficulties of the patient, enhancing the former and identifying and working through the latter.  The dialogue in the therapeutic relationship aids the patient in self-discovery and in the process of emotionally and mentally maturing.

#####Who seeks help from a psychologist or psychoanalyst?

That individual - male or female - who understands that at times we need help, and that it is beneficial to and fostering of the very process of maturing when we can accept and receive this help when it is needed.

#####What is the difference between the help a psychiatrist gives and the help received from a psychologist?

Classical psychiatry considers that internal and interpersonal conflicts can and should be treated by influencing brain chemistry through the use of sophisticated psychiatric drugs that can help us feel calm and more stable.  Making changes to our brain chemistry is used to treat the symptoms that the psychiatric patient reports.  A psychiatrist is a physician and has specialized in psychiatry. The psychologist treats his/her patients through therapy, which is a relationship that is created in order to treat the internal and/or interpersonal conflicts that the patient presents. The psychologist has taken his/her degrees in psychology, specializing in clinical psychology, and the psychologist who conducts therapies has received extensive post-graduate training in performing psychotherapy.

#####What are the credentials and the training that my psychologist or analyst should have in Spain?

Your specialist must have satisfied the university requirements that the local licensure board requests, and be licensed. He or she must be well integrated in his/her local professional community. In addition, extended and rigorous training from locally recognized post-graduate centers in psychotherapy must be completed if your practitioner conducts therapy. Your practitioner must have been treated over an extended period of time as a patient by a mental health professional with specific training status from a recognized professional association.  If this practioner practices psychoanalysis an even more specific and specialized post-graduate training is necessary.

#####What are mixed treatments?

Some patients with very specific personality characteristics are better helped when treated simultaneously by a psychologist and a psychiatrist. In these cases both of these professionals join together to form a therapeutic team for the patient. Sometimes a patient who is treated by a psychologist will require medication momentarily. A mixed treatment refers to receiving both psychotherapy from a psychologist and psychiatric medication from a psychiatrist.

#####Why is psychiatric medication usually not enough?

Skillfully and conservatively prescribed medication is often very valuable for controlling symptoms to provide relief, but is only a symptomatic treatment. It is sometimes misrepresented as being more than symptomatic treatment.
