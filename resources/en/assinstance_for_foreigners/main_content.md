#Assistance for foreigners

Over the last 25 years this mental health practitioner has had the opportunity to develop excellent assistance for foreigners who have come to Spain for brief visits, as well as for expats properly speaking, who have moved here as a new life project. Men, women and young adults barely out of adolescence have come to Barcelona, to Catalonia and to this practice from many different countries of the western world for a variety of reasons: on a cultural visit, seeking professional opportunities, or following a spouse who is, amongst other motives, and having to face numerous different personal problems that a demanding adventure like relocating to a foreign country can stir up or sometimes cause.
